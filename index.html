            I have been studying HTML and CSS and the experience has been good.Here are links to <strong>some of the projects</strong> I did to ensure my mastery of concept:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="myfirstwebsite.html">myfirstwebsite</li></a>This was the project that helped me understand how to use the ordered and unordered lists.
                <li><a href="HTMLPage1.html">HTMLPage1</li></a>This basically mage me understand how to link different websites to my page.
                <li><a href="Cascading.html">Cascading</li></a>This was the project after learning how to insert different styleson my webpage.
                <li><a href="myproject.html">mypoject</a></li>This helped me finalise everything and learn how to apply inline CSS to my work.
            </ul>

        <p>
            I decided to take the web development class because:
            <ul>
                <li>It is close to my line of interest.</li>
                <li>I wanted to develop a new skill and this came in handy.</li>
                <li>It was not a complex course to take on your own.</li>
            </ul>
            It has been an interesting journey filled with challenges but we learn from our mistakes on a daily.<br />The process has helped me acqire a new skill and undersand web development deeper.
